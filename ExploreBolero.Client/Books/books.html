<p>
    Note! After upgradring from preview-7 to preview-9, there appears to be an issue with how
    the check for logged in user is done. In the left menu, the last item can be a message
    stating that you are logged in as . That is, the user name appears to be a blank string.
    If you click that message to log out, then you are redirected to the login page.
