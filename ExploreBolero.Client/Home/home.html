	<h1 class="title is-4">Welcome!</h1>
	<p>
		This application is my playground for exploring features in Bolero,
		Bulma, and possibly other tools that I use to build my business applications.
		By keeping these explorations in a public repo, I hope to give some value back
		to the community and the creators of Bolero, Bulma and other great tools.
	</p>
	<p>
		The application was originally developed from this
		template - https://github.com/Tarmil/bolero.template.structured - and
		then I refactored and adjusted it to my liking before going on to explore
		more Bulma stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
		The original Counter and Books demo pages, and the following bullet points from the
		original Home page, has been kept. They work the same in the Bolero default template
		and in the structured template, but as the name somewhat hints at, the structured
		template takes advantage of Elmish submodels. There are also many other differences
		that are important when developing applications that grow.

			The menu on the left switches pages based on
			<a target="_blank" href="https://fsbolero.github.io/docs/Routing">routes</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <a href="/counter">Counter</a> page demonstrates event handlers and data binding in
			<a target="_blank" href="https://fsbolero.github.io/docs/Templating">HTML templates</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
			The <a href="/data">Download data</a> page demonstrates the use of
			<a target="_blank" href="https://fsbolero.github.io/docs/Remoting">remote functions</a>.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Several more Bulma demos are in the workings.
