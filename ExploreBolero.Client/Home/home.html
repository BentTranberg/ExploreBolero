        First of all, if you run this application from VS, then don't be surprised if
        it appears to freeze for half a minute or so, and then be a bit sluggish some
        seconds after that as well. I suspect this has something to do with debugging
        functionality that needs to traverse "the tree".

    <p>
        This demo is currently at Bolero v 0.9, and is tested with .NET Core SDK 3.0.100
        and VS 2019 16.3.1
    </p>
	<p>
		This application is my playground for exploring features in Bolero,
		Bulma, and possibly other tools that I use to build my business applications.
		By keeping these explorations in a public repo, I hope to give some value back
		to the community and the creators of Bolero, Bulma and other great tools.
	</p>
	<p>
		The application was originally developed from this
		template - https://github.com/Tarmil/bolero.template.structured - and
		then I refactored and adjusted it to my liking before going on to explore
		more Bulma stuff.
	</p>
	<p>
		The original Counter and Books demo pages, and the following bullet points from the
		original Home page, has been kept. They work the same in the Bolero default template
		and in the structured template, but as the name somewhat hints at, the structured
		template takes advantage of Elmish submodels. There are also many other differences
		that are important when developing applications that grow.
